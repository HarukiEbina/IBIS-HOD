# IBIS-HOD
A directory to analyze high-redshift galaxies from the XMM-LSS field of the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS).

The organization is as follows:
- `data_measurements` to measure the necessary quantities from data
- `hod` to run operations on the AbacusSummit HOD box
- `mc` to run MC over iterated realizations of the observation, using the observation mask and random offsets on the HOD box
