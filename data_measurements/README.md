# Directory to calculate properties directly from the data file

1. `calc_lae_wR*.py` calculates the projected clustering $w_R$ for each sample
2. `calculate_f2*.py` calculates the normalization of $w_R$ from $dn/dz$ for each sample
3. `compute_ibis_fint_v4.py` calculates the interloper fraction for each sample

`desi2-filters.fits` stores the medium-band filter curves used for target selections.
